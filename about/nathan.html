            <p>I am Nathan Cortez, a good student who seeks success in life. I transferred from academia to try a new quality of teaching and the fellowship of the entire school. For our students, I am a varsity student at this school. It gave me a good experience. We won the representative secondary men's volleyball championship and entered the provincial meet and won the silver medal. This was a great joy for the school and we were part of raising the quality of our school. I have reached the point where I am getting an award in my studies, although at the same time, the training and study were manageable and it will bear good fruit for me. I will graduate with an education and an honor that my parents will be proud of.</p>
