            <p>Hello, My name is john Benedict Manangan. I am a major contributor to this website. Majoring in Computer Engineering, an amateur player of the violin, and a avid player of chess. I wrote about 80% of this website with my fellows contributing pictures and writing their own pages. They also contributed the code that made the registration. aside from that, I also contributed to the design of the website. I am very proud of this website and I hope you like it as much as we do.</p>
            <p>About 2 years ago from now, or around 2024 i transferred to ADP on my first year ofsenior high school. It feels rather bizzare to be quite nostalgic on a saturday, erhm well on a sunday at 1:11am. However Back then i was rather nervice to meeting a new group of people. I was indeed accompanied by a friend and schoolmate from my previous school, however due to seating distance and various reason we ended up not interacting much for the first school year.</p>
            <p>However, as time went by, i was able to meet new people and make new friends. I was able to find a group of friends that i can call my own. I was also able to interact with my former fellows more and more. I am very grateful for the people that i met in ADP and the experiences that i had. I am also very grateful for the opportunities that ADP has given me. I am looking forward to the rest and end of my senior high school journey.</p>
            <p>I am quite shocked by how much I've grown and learned in such a short time. Being here with new people and having fresh interactions, has helped me mature and develop as a person.</p>
            <p>Im also quite please to know and experience that teh quality of education is far higher than my previous schools. I quite enjoyed interacting and learning from the teachers here. Shoutout to my Advisors Ma'am Beth for helping on my first year, and to Ma'am gelyn for being a memorable teacher i can count on. at the time of writing this i am very tearful.</p>
            <p>I would also like to thank Ma'am Divine for introducing and helping me start my programming journey, by teaching us HTML, and CSS. I would also like to express my grattitude to Ma'am Razen for being a great teacher, I am grateful because her lessons are always detailed and easy to understand.</p>
