            <p>During my two years experience here in Academia de Pulilan, I learned many things, I made new friends, new funny memories with my friends, and I learned new skills.
            <p>One thing I loved about my experience here in Academia de Pulilan Senior Highschool is that they have swimming lessons, and because of our coach Sir Aris, I found my sport. I never knew that I could swim well until I went to Academia de Pulilan and I found it amusing. Especially, during our very very last session, I learned the swimming style I've been wanting to learn since I was a kid and I was so shocked that I could do that so I asked my friend Benedict to take a video of me. Thanks to Academia de Pulilan and our coach Sir Aris, I was able to find my sport that suits my strengths.</p>
            <p>Another very special person for me is my friend Kian Riley, he's from the elementary department of Academia de Pulilan, we were far apart from each other, but each time we met when there's an event, it's always so fun. Kian Riley is my friend from our Parish Ministry of altar servers. I didn't expect him to be in Academia de Pulilan when I enrolled for grade 11. I felt happy when I heard that he is also in ADP since i treat him like my brother. Every event or almost every event, we had a picture but I couldn't find the other picture.</p>
            <p>Now, the most memorable moment and days of my life. Our retreat at Hermosa, Bataan. I'm a student who usually don't join field trips ever since I started going to school, so our retreat meant a lot  for me, especially because I was also with Lindsay, my girlfriend. But, the part I enjoyed about our retreat the most is our way home. Something happened that I don't know if I am allowed to share here, that made me laugh a lot.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the first friday mass for each month. Every first week of the month usually Wednesday or Thursday, I and my friend Keidy are the ones usually taking care of the things needed in mass, including the trainings of altar servers, choir, and other servers too. All that work made us complete every first friday mass succesfuly, but it also gave me the skill to lead a group of servers and be a great teacher or leader to them.</p>

            <h2>My Swimming Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Here's a video of me swimming the Dolphin and butterfly stroke.
                These are swimming styles I learned during my last swimming session
                at Academia de Pulilan. I was so surprised that I could do it,
                and I was so happy that I could finally learn it.
